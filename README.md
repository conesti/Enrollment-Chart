# Enrollment-Chart
This is a step towards my final project for an R class I am taking as an undergraduate where I analyze course enrollment data.  
I begin looking at only on year's data.
This year shows one breakdown of enrollment by department.
Then the next step is to look at past years and see how this distribution evolves over time.
After that, one can take a closer look at the distribution within specific classes that may have affected the overall trend.
